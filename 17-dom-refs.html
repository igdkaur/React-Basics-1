<!-- We have a function component called Tilt. 
but we can make it do something fancy 
by using a library that I've included called vanilla-tilt. 
----
Vanilla-tilt takes a DOM node and 
makes it react to when the user mouses over that DOM node.
---
The DOM node we want to give it is the DOM node 
that's created for this element, 
the tilt root. 

Remember this is a React element, 
not a DOM node and 
React takes that React element and renders it to the DOM.

We need React to give us the DOM node 
that creates for this particular React element 
so we can wire up vanilla-tilt to it. 
To do this, 
---
we're going to use a ref prop and 
<div ref ={ }> </div>
we need to pass a ref which is an object that has a mutable current property.
-----


use the React.useRef hook. 
From that we'll get our tiltRef and 
then we can copy that, paste it here to our ref. 
ref ={tiltRef}
Then the tiltRef is an object that has a current property.

 That current property is the current value for this ref object.

In our case, because we're passing this ref to a div with a ref prop, 
that current property will be the DOM node 
that React creates for this div. 


If we console.log tiltRef.current, and 
we save that then we should be seeing the DOM node.
That current property is the current value for this ref object.
 const tiltRef = React.useRef()

We actually see undefined. 
The reason we see that is 
because at the time that this function runs, 
React has not created the DOM node for this div, 
so the tiltRef.current is currently undefined. 
In fact, you can initialize that current value by passing an 
argument to their useRef hook.
const tiltRef = React.useRef("here pass") 

how do we get the DOM node so we can initialize vanilla-tilt on it? 


The reason that useRef is an object 
that has a current property is so 
that we can mutate the current property to be whatever we want 
without triggering a re-render of our component. 
We can use refs for more than just DOM nodes like we're using here.
 We can use it for any value that we want to keep track of and 
 mutate over time without triggering a re-render of our component.
 After a component has been mounted, 
 our useEffect callback is going to be called. 
 We get the tilt node from our tilt ref current property. 
 We create some vanilla-tilt options and pass those to the initialization for our tilt node with vanilla-tilt.
Then we return a cleanup function so that we can remove all references of our DOM node in vanilla-tilt and remove all the event listeners that vanilla-tilt put on our DOM node. -->
