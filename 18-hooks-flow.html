The first thing that we see is this app render start. 
That's the first thing that happens when we call ReactDom.render our app. 
It calls our app Function Component.

The next thing that happens is we call react.useState and 
immediately React is going to call this function 
to retrieve the initial state for our show child state. 
That's why we're getting this app useState callback called.


Then, we call all these React useEffects, 
but you'll notice that the logs 
in those are not the next thing that appear in our console. 
Instead, we actually create this element and 
then we get a log to the console for app render end. 

Once that happens, React actually is updating the DOM. 
Then, asynchronously later, it's going to call our useEffect callbacks, 
one at a time in the order in which they were called.

app useEffect to no deps is the first one that appears. 
We don't get our cleanup because there's no cleanup necessary yet, 
because right now, we're just mounting the component, and we haven't had any updates yet.
Next, we get our useEffects empty deps, right here. 
We have an empty list of dependencies there and 
then useEffect with dep. That's our show child's state. 
That's the next thing that gets called here.

what happens when we click on show child. 

If I click show child, 
then we're going to get an app render start. 
When we click show child, that triggers this on change 
to set show child to the checked value of our check box input.

This set show child is going to trigger a re-render of our app, 
which is why we get our app render start.

We'll say app render start, and 
we'll go through all of this code just like we had at the previous render, 
except this time you'll notice we don't have an app use state callback, 
we go straight from app render start to app render end.


When you use a function callback to set the initial state in a useState hook, 
it is only called when initially rendered.

This is because React has already retrieved 
the initial state value for our show child state, and 
it doesn't need to retrieve that value again. 
Any time you use a function call back for use state, 
that function is only going to be called 
when this component is initially rendered for the rest of the lifetime of that component.


We go through all these useEffect cause again, 
we create our element, and t
hen we log to the console that the app render has finished. 
Then React calls our child to start rendering of that child. 
One thing that I want to stress here is that we're creating our element 
which includes creating the child right here.

You'll notice that we get to this line of code 
before we start rendering the child. 
The important thing to remember here is that just 
because you create a React element, 
doesn't mean that React element's function is going to get called, 
because you're not calling the function, React is.

React will only call that function 
when that component is actually going to be rendered. 
That's really important because you could say Const UI I will not render, and 
render a whole bunch of these all day long, and 
unless those things are added to some UI that's actually going to get rendered, 
all that you're creating is a bunch of React element objects, and 
you won't actually be calling into that child function.
