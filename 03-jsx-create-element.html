<!-- interact directly with React’s createElement API to create React elements and 
then hand those off to React DOM to get them to show up on the screen. 
But it’s not the most ergonomic API to write our UI code in. 
It’s hard to track when one element starts and the next one ends.

This is why the React team came up with JSX. 
It’s an extension to the JavaScript language to support syntax that looks similar to the HTML 
that you would write to create these DOM elements. 
JSX gives us an expressive syntax for representing our UI, without losing the benefits and powers of writing our UI in JavaScript. 
how JSX is compiled to regular JavaScript calls -->

<!-- 
this is not JavaScript code. This is JSX. The browser does not understand this natively. 
It needs to be compiled from this to something that the browser can understand. That's where Babel comes in.
Babel is a JavaScript compiler supporting the next generation of JavaScript as well as non-standard features like JSX 
Babel is managing, compiling code down to JavaScript that the browser can execute using React APIs.
