<!-- create React elements and then use ReactDOM to render those elements to the page. -->

<!-- Reactâ€™s createElement API to create React elements and then hand those off to React DOM to get them to show up on the screen. -->
  <!-- 
  1. need react and react dom on page
        react - create elements
        react dom -  to render the elements to page
        use unpkg to get react on page
        we still need to get access to some element that's on the page so we can render our elements to that DOM node. -- we use div with id root
  2. after we have react and react dom - create react elements and render them to page via react dom
  3. process- render our element to root element
  4. react element is not same as the DOM element created via document.
  5. created via React.createElement with react

differences
  6. api not same as doc
      the first argument in both is type of element but 
      but instead of getting the element and attaching properties to it, we specify those properties on creation as an object.
      const element = React.createElement('div', {})

      -----js----
      const element = document.createElement('div')
      ----- react ----
      const element = React.createElement('div', {
          className: 'container',
          children: 'Hello World',
        })
  7. Another difference is instead of text content, we specify children. 
  8. the element is not a DOM node.-- $$typeOf : Symbol(react.element) - denotes that its a react element
  9. other ways to add children property 
      1-----
      const element = React.createElement('div', {
        className: 'container',
      
      }, 
      'Hello World',
      'hello again'
      )
     
      get element props children as array

      2----
      can use children prop directly

      const element = React.createElement('div', {
          className: 'container',
          children:['Hello World','Hello Again']
        })
      

      3----
      creating additional React elements to be children

      const element = React.createElement('div', {
        children: React.createElement('span',null,'Hello','World'),
        className: 'Hello World',
      })

      
      type of span, the props are null, the children are an array of "Hello" and "World". 
      in dev tools - we'll see props, children, and children is just another React element that itself has props. And that children is an array of two strings. -->
