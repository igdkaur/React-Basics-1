<!-- for storing some state into localStorage and 
keeping it synchronized 
useful in other areas of our application
make a function
generalize the code 
Instead of getting the item with the string name, 
 it might make more sense for the user of this function 
 to provide us a key for localStorage, 
 so we'll accept a parameter called key.

 Instead of this as a default value, 
 it might make sense for people to provide us their own default value. 
 We'll accept that as another parameter. We can default 
 that to an empty string just in case they don't want to provide it. -->

 <!-- we're going to need to get access to that stateUpdater function and 
 to the state value itself. 
 Let's return state and setState. 
 We can make our custom Hook have a similar API 
 to useState so it's familiar to people who are used to the useState Hook.

 what we did here is we took some code 
 that was in our function component. 
 We moved it into its own function and 
 then called it from our function component. 
 This was no different from any other regular 
 javaScript refactor, which makes it easy to share logic across components and even make open source libraries that expose custom Hooks like this.

 use prefix on our custom Hooks so that we follow the community convention and the ESLint plugin can help us avoid mistakes.

 Before, we had this key hardcoded as name. 
 It couldn't ever change. My dependency array didn't need to include that. Now, I'm accepting a key as a parameter from the users of the LocalStorageState custom Hook. They could potentially change that value. If they do, then I need to make sure to respond to that change 
 so that I update local storage and not lose any of the user's work
 It's important that in your applications you use and follow that ESLint rule so you can avoid bugs like this. 
 With this in mind, we could make this useLocalStorageState Hook a lot more robust by removing the item at the old key if that key has changed. 
 I'm going to leave that as a fun exercise for you to do late -->
